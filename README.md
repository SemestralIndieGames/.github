# Semestral Indie Games

**Creating games with soul, shadows, and strange beauty.**

_Semes­tral Indie Games_ is a creative studio focused on designing unique and atmospheric video games. Each project we build is an exploration—of mechanics, of emotion, of decay and rebirth. We are driven by experimentation, narrative systems, and the belief that small teams can craft unforgettable worlds.

Our current project:

## 🕯️ Final Fragment

*A card-based roguelite set in a dying world—where flesh, memory, and power twist into something unholy.*

> "There are no heroes left. Only fragments."

In **Final Fragment**, you take control of a cursed character wandering corrupted lands, collecting memories, mutations, and abilities while fighting your way through hostile paths. The experience blends tactical deck-building with dark worldbuilding, roguelite structure, and a visually striking 2D presentation.

- ⚔️ Card-based tactical combat with dynamic upgrades  
- 🧬 Mutations that alter both stats and appearance  
- 🗺️ Non-linear map progression with events, ambushes, and choices   

Built with [Godot 4.4](https://godotengine.org/) using **C#**, handcrafted visuals, shaders, and an original narrative structure. Designed for PC and web.
