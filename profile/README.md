# **🌑 Semestral Indie Games: The Standard of the Forge**

*"One work. One cycle. A gift to the void."*

Welcome to the digital chronicles of **Semestral Indie Games**. This space is more than a mere code repository; it is the record of a ritual struggle against time and silence. Here, we document the bending of nodes and the invocation of logic to erect monuments to visceral horror and wounded beauty.

## **🏛️ The Oath of the Six Moons**

I have sworn upon black marble to deliver a new work of visceral horror every six moons (180 days). This GitHub is the altar where technical runes (code) come to life before being delivered unto the world free of charge.

* **Cadence:** 1 work per semester.  
* **Philosophy:** Art is a sanctuary, and a sanctuary is not sold; it is offered.  
* **Tool:** The **Godot Engine**, used as the hammer that shapes what should not exist.

## **⚒️ In the Forge (Current Project)**

### **🕹️ \[Name of the Condensed Metroidvania\]**

A visceral descent into a world of satin scars and rusted steel.

* **Status:** Initial gestation (Day 1 of 180).  
* **Technology:** Godot Engine / GDScript.  
* **Objective:** A short, heavy, and atmospheric experience that will mutate over time.

## **🕯️ The Legacy and the Covenant**

If the shadows I cast here resonate with your will, you may follow the tolling of the bell across my other domains:

## **📜 A Note for the Wanderers**

The code within these repositories is the bone and tendon of my works. For the **Hierophants of the Gear** (Tier III Patrons), this place holds the technical secrets that sustain my nightmares. If you seek to learn or collaborate in the name of horror, you are welcome to observe the runes.

*"Time is ash. Creation is eternal."*

*In the name of Silence, Art, and the Eternal Cadence.*
